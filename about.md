Welcome to ITV’s official technology blog.

We are an integrated producer broadcaster that creates, owns and distributes content across the world, and operate the largest commercial family of TV channels in the UK covering nearly half the TV advertising market.

In 2016 we produced and delivered 7,800 hours of original content from production labels in 10 countries, and served over a billion on-demand and catch-up TV requests to 17 million registered users across 27 platforms in the UK.

Technology is playing a growing role in our story, which we want to tell here, on our blog. Our systems range from mainframes in data-centres to microservices in the cloud, and we want to share stories from the various disciplines that are integral to a successful technology business such as engineering, product, design and management.

We think there has never been a more exciting time to join technology here at ITV as hopefully the articles on this blog demonstrate. If you think you’d like to be apart of what we’re doing here at ITV then please check out our open roles [LINK]
